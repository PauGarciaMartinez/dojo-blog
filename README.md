## About language and framework

For this project, I've used JavaScript (ES6+), Vue 3 with Composition API and Vue Router, and Firebase.

This app consists in a blog with a homepage that lists every post. By clicking them, you can access all post details. You can filter by tag, and create and delete posts, too.
